STM8 Templates with Arduino look&feel 
=================

This repository provides C-libraries & -templates for the low-cost [STM8A and STM8S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STM8) 8-bit microcontrollers by [STMicro](http://st.com).

Where sensible, compatibility with Arduino has been kept. However, due to focus on easy porting to new STM8 boards and some new features, 100% Arduino-compatibility was not always achieveable. If you seek this, please check out the [sduino project](https://github.com/tenbaht/sduino) instead. 

- details on installation and usage can be found on the [Docu](Docu) page
- an API description can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/gicking/STM8_templates/wiki)
- for bugs reports, feature requests, please drop me a note or use the [issues page](https://github.com/gicking/STM8_templates/issues)
- for legal stuff see file "LICENSE".
- and, last but not least, volunteers are highly welcome...

Have fun!
