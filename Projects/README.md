STM8 Example Projects
=================================

Loose collection of STM8 projects for SDCC or Cosmic compilers. These can be used as starting point for own projects. If you have implemented an interesting STM8 project, please consider contributing it to this repository. Thanks in advance!  

For tool installation and usage see page [Docu](../Docu).


[General](General_Examples) Examples
----------------------------------
Generic, board independent STM8 projects routines and macros in C.


[STM8S Discovery](STM8S_Discovery_Examples) Examples
----------------------------------
Some STM8S Discovery board specific projects. Basically these account for specific LED


[muBoard](muBoard_Examples) Examples
----------------------------------
muBoard v2.3 specific routines and macros. This board was developed for IC validation and testing at [Robert Bosch GmbH](http://www.bosch.com). For an overview of board functions see [here](https://frosch.piandmore.de//de/pam9/call/public-media/event_media/160611_Vortrag_Interpreter.pdf) (in German).
